New version (2012-08-13) allows to install mods. Modding API has only basic functions, but we are adding more as required and as requested.

Mod releases can be found on [wiki] (http://manicdigger.sourceforge.net/wiki/index.php/Mod) and on [forum] (http://manicdigger.sourceforge.net/forum/viewforum.php?f=17).

Now Iâ€™ll be adding bigger inventory, ability to have more than 256 block types, simple tools, and modding functions for monsters.
