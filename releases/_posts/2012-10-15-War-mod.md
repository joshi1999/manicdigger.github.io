Features:

* Four weapons: pistol, submachine gun, shotgun, sniper rifle. They differ in accuracy, delay, damage, number of bullets, etc.
* Three classes: soldier, medic (gives medical kit), support (gives ammo).
* Mode command. It allows to switch between collaborative map creation and play, without leaving the game server.
* Ammo reloading (R key. Respawn is now O key.)
* Iron sights (right click)
* Countdown to respawn. Players are respawned every 30 seconds. Dead player model.

* 3d sound
* Network is done now with UDP instead of TCP to reduce lag.
* Inventory scrolling.

The idea for war mod comes from Ace of Spades game.

To host your own War mode server currently you must change Mods/current.txt file from “Fortress” to “War”.
